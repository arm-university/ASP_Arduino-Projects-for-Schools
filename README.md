# Arduino-Projects-for-Schools
Arduino MKR Projects for Schools is a colourful entry-level resource, which introduces learners to the exciting world of microcontrollers, the Internet of Things and Data Science. Learners use both simulators and physical devices to build systems and solve real-life problems.

## Resource Aim
To introduce learners to Physical Computing, the Internet of Things and Machine Learning through engaging hands-on, real-world projects using an Arduino and peripherals.

## Learning Outcomes
- To develop an understanding, from beginner to advanced level, of the Internet of Things, and how it is enabled by embedded systems, sensors and cloud-based data science platforms
- To understand how to connect electronic components to create physical computing projects
- To understand how Arduino devices and peripherals can be applied to solve real-world problems
- To understand the basics of data analysis and machine learning

## Resource Structure
The course is a series of 20 individual projects that build in complexity. The resources are split across Key Stages (3-5):

- 7 projects at Key Stage 3 (Middle School) - ages 11-14
- 7 projects at Key Stage 4 (High School) - ages 14-16
- 6 projects at Key Stage 5 (Seniors) - ages 16-18

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
